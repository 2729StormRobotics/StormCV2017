# StormCV2017

Computer Vision code for the 2017 FRC season.  This is a GRIP based vision system.  We utilize the "Genereate Code" feature in order to run python code on our Raspberry pi 3.

## Getting Started

If you wish to use our setup just clone this repo to your raspberry pi
```
git clone https://github.com/2729StormRobotics/StormCV2017.git
```

## Project Structure
-  Base directory: start-mjg-streamer.sh streams video to port 1181. 
-  /GRIP-CodeGeneration: Vision processing code.  run_cv.py is changed manually for desired calcuations
-  /GRIP-CodeGeneration: All other .py files are generated by GRIP tools>GenerateCode.

### Prerequisites

We use python3 and OpenCV3 on our raspberrypi3.  Python is super easy to install...
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

OpenCV3 is a bit more of a pain.  Here's a helpful link...

Also on a windows computer you will need Eclipse with the wpilib plugins.  Here's a helpful link...

## Running the Code
Assuming you've gotten all the installs running the code is fairly straightforward
- Connect both the pi and Windows machine to the same network
- On eclipse press WPIlib>RunOutlineViewer>StartServer
- Run the python code in the StormCV2017/GRIP-CodeGeneration directory
```
python3 run_cy.py
```
